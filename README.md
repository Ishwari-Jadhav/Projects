## 🧩 Projects Overview

- **Blogging Application**
A console-based application to manage blog posts with CRUD operations, file handling, and structured data storage.

- **Chat Messenger with Logging Facility**
Simulates message exchange with logging support to store communication history securely using file operations.

- **Customised Database Management System**
Implements a lightweight DBMS supporting insert, delete, search, and display operations using data structures.

- **Customised Virtual File System**
A virtual file system simulation supporting file creation, deletion, read/write operations without using OS-level files.

- **EduTrack – Classroom & Student Management Portal**
Manages student records, classroom data, and academic details with structured input handling.

- **File Packer-Unpacker**
Combines multiple files into a single packed file and later restores them, demonstrating file system and metadata handling.

- **Generalised Data Structures Library**
A reusable library implementing common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

- **Secure File Transfer Simulation**
Implements file encryption and decryption using Caesar Cipher and XOR Cipher, with client-server DLL interaction.

- **Study Tracker App**
Tracks study sessions and progress to help users manage learning goals efficiently.
